# CS-Cart composer installation
This repository allows you to install cs-cart with composer (but still not really elegant as cs-cart is not supporting it natively).

# Install
1. Rename `setup-config.template.patch` to `setup-config.patch` in `patches/cscart/cscart-ultimate/` and replace the values with yours (will be used for the console installation)
